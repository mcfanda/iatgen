\title{Data analysis function: Estimate reliability of IAT}
\usage{
IATreliability(data, inclusive.sd = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An object created by \code{cleanIAT()} representing a cleaned IAT.}
}
\value{
Returns reliability estimate and split-half correlation. In addition, D scores for odd and even trials can be viewed, as can the component practice and critical D scores.
}
\description{
One can easily estimate the IAT reliability by scoring the IAT separately based on odd and even trials and compute a split-half reliability. This is accomplished using \code{IATreliability()}, which sorts trials in order by type (positive, negative, target A, target B), takes alternating trials in order of presentation, scores and correlates the IAT, and applies a split-half spearman-brown correction (De Houwer & De Bruycker, 2007). This ensures an even distribution of targets and categories in odd/even trialsets.
